Welcome to my professional portfolio. I am a recent MBA student set to graduate with a focus on business strategy and digital marketing. I have worked on strategic initiatives and I am passionate about leveraging data-driven insights to drive growth. This site highlights my resume, key projects and skills. I hold a Bachelor's degree from United States InternatIonal University- Africa and have completed internships at Umande Trust and Kenya National Commission on Human Rights where I developed a strong foundation in market analysis and leadership enabling me to start my own venture Pink Harlem. My experience running a business has sharpened skills in project management, strategic planning and team collaboration.
